Welcome to the repository!

Here, you'll find the R code used to produce the results in the paper:

<i>Chang, C. J., Oâ€™Brien, K. M., Keil, A. P., Gaston, S. A., Jackson, C. L., Sandler, D. P., & White, A. J. (2022). Use of straighteners and other hair products and incident uterine cancer. JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 114(12), 1636-1645.</i>

I hope you find this code helpful and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me at che-jung.chang@nih.gov. Your feedback is greatly valued as I am committed to transparent and collaborative research.

All the data necessary to reproduce the analysis are publicly available via request on the Sister Study website: Sister Study Data Requests (https://sisterstudy.niehs.nih.gov/English/data-requests.htm).

Thank you for visiting, and happy coding!
